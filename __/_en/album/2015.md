Never before has our name _Triangelos_ been more appriopriate. _The Seventh Day_ tells the story of _the three angels_ from Revelation 14. They signify the last three important messages that Jesus wants His church to proclaim to the earth before He returns.

It is our prayer that the songs on this album will enable you to experience the same enthusiasm and joy for the three angels as we ourselves have.

Jesus will return soon, and His invitation goes out to us all, to accept His offer of grace and to make a stand on His side in the great controversy of this world.
