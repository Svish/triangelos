I'm committed to making a difference in the community where I live by promoting environmentally friendly lifestyle habits - everything from what we eat, to having a garden, and even what we clean our houses with.

I believe God wants us to take care of each other, but also to take care of the beautiful nature He has given us.

My favorite Bible verse is Romans 5:5 where God talks about how he is pouring out His love in our hearts.

> Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
